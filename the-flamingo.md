The flamingo is a wonderfully flamboyant piece of lettering and window artwork - the original even has illustrations of flamingos on the surrounding windows. A great choice for a beach environment, the letters feel as though they were drawn quickly and casually by a marker.

The intro word is set in a contrastingly straight-laced blocky sans serif. The drop shadow is appropriately sized and balanced with the letterforms.
