Gauntlett manor is a combination of a script and a serif. The script is a fairly simple one except for the flourishes on the first letter. 

The serif has some interesting choices in the shapes of its letters. The apex of the ‘A’ seems very high. Type designers and lettering artists often make optical adjustments by drawing triangular shapes to extend past the cap height, but this seems a little excessive. The ‘O’ seems to be drawn around a diagonal axis or is just crooked somehow. Finally, the ‘R’ has both the bowl and leg joining with the stem, making that middle area a bit heavy and strange-looking.
