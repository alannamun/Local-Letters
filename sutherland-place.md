Sutherland Place is right on the edge of what I still consider South Granville. This particular 3 or 4 block radius has a very eclectic mix of funky lettering. The variation in contrast and size of the letterforms definitely makes it feel kind of bouncy but I think the swooping ball terminals on the ends give it the most “loopiness”.

It both starts and end with these loopy ball terminals, even bending the shape of the “e” to mimic the tail of the “d” above. The other strange thing is that the numbers were also, hand-painted but in a completely different style. They seem to be in a rounded (space-age?) sans serif that had little relation to the script. This could be due to one of the the letters or number being newer than the other.
