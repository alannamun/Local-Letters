This dull concrete building is endowed with some of the most beautifully done lettering in the neighbourhood. The craft of the painting and guilding is very high quality and the letter shapes retain a number of imperfections that give it that hand-drawn character.

The Queen Anne starts with a beautifully detailed and elaborate “Q”, especially when compared to the rest of the letters. the letters all seem fairly even and well-spaced within each word, but ‘Anne’ has noticeably more space and slightly bigger letters. 

It is interesting how the connector to the “n” comes all the way up to the top and actually starts the downward stroke. The other interesting latter is the “C” which looks like the bottom has been shifted over toward the “E” slightly. 

Finally, there were little flower details across the windows without letters, but the address was unfortunately stuck to the window in vinyl.
