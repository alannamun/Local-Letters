The Wendalin is in South Granville, but the style of the lettering seems to fit a more beach-like atmosphere. The wavy line brings up imagery of the sea and the tittle of the “i” is in the shape of a fish. 

This piece of lettering is unique from most of the other ones because it keeps the “the” in the same style as the main word. Many other pieces have separate styles for the main word and lead-in word. Instead, it seems like the numbers are in a different style with their ball terminals in contrast to the casual script.
