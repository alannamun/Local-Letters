Marion’s Manor starts out with a wonderfully steep angle, and slowly becomes more upright by the end of the second word. This is a beautiful example of how hand lettering can get funky (especially when sitting on a ladder and writing it backwards on the inside of a window). The ‘M’s are impressively similar though. 

The choice to offset the connectors is also an interesting one. It brings attention to them and interrupts the flow of the word, further emphasizing its hand-made qualities.
