I was particularly attracted to Wynne Manor because of its upright emphasis and nearly straight decender in the lowercase ‘y’ character. I also enjoyed the blunt angle on the ’n’ communicates the quick change in direction that a brush would have made when creating the letter. 

Unlike all the other letters, the uppercase ‘M’ has terminals that taper into sharp edges. The stems also bow inward in contrast to the outward bowing stems of the other letters. Finally, the weight seems to vary quite a bit between letters with straight sides and ones with rounded sides – particularly noticable between ’n’ and ‘e’.
