The Westwind is a flowing script with an appropriate wave in the bar of the “t” that adds to its appearance of the word blowing in the wind. The letters are pretty traditional except for the script transition of the “s”, which comes up, stops abruptly and swoops across the letter. 

It can also be noted that the tittle of the “i” seems quite large and overstated. Size variation between the “es” and “wind” can also be noted, without the “t” to break them up, this would be more noticeable.
