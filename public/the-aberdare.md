The Aberdare is a flowing script with well matched numbers and a small bit of sans serif. The split shading is a huge feature of these letters. This type of shading seems to be created by the guilding process. The highlighting could have been created by painting on a clear coat before applying the gold leaf – But I’m just speculating.

I am impressed by how well the letters flow into each other. The lower case ‘r’ in the middle is particularly flowing and liquid-like.
