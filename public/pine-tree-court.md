This is one of the more unique signs in the neighbourhood mainly because it’s a serif instead of the usual script. The “Pi” ligature is perhaps the most interesting part as the “P” comes right around and forms the dot of the “i” right inside the bowl. 

The large, exaggerated serifs on the bottom of the “P” help to draw the shape of the entire composition, echoing the baseline curve that “Pine” and “Tree” sit on. The “t” on the end of “court” is quite peculiar as it is quite a bit larger than the rest of the letters in the word.
