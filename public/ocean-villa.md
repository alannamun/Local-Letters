Ocean Villa screams late 60’s/early 70’s to me. Its psychedelic, bell-bottom like flowing forms speak of lazy days of love on the beach. The original piece, painted on the window is unique in the fact that the usual black background has been replaced with a dark blue. It also includes a circular insignia on either side possibly painted to look like blue marble.

The shading is a bit different as well, most pieces of apartment lettering add an extra layer of shading for depth, but this piece seems to add more of an inline, like it is accentuating the flowing shapes. More movement is achieved through the curl in the terminal of the ‘c’ and the flowing ‘V’. 

The ‘a’ has a very interesting shape, as if the it was drawn as a whole and then the counter was chopped out of it as an oval. It doesn’t follow what the flow of a pen would draw, which interrupts the feel for me. It also seems to make the ‘a’ quite a bit more dense than the other letters, making it call even more attention to itself.
