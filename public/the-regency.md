The Regency is a tall blue-tiled building with a large entrance way. The entrance seems to be saying “this is a very elegant place to live,” and the letters are a huge part of that.

The most peculiar letter is probably the “y” – at first I thought it might just be backwards, but it still doesn’t quite look right when flipped. I think it is strange because of the direction that it curls, no pen stroke would naturally flow that way.

Not to be overlooked is the script for the word “The”. It adds a certain elegance, especially when combined with the serif. I really enjoy the strange oblong ball terminals.
