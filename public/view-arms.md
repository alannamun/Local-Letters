The original on the window was a bit damaged, so I had to really do a double take at the name of this building. I’m not really sure what ”view arms” are. 

The lettering is quite beautiful with large flourishes on the capital letters and heavy, dramatic drop shadows to contrast its thin, delicate letterforms. The baseline is quite angular, which is common on entrances with two skinny windows. Each word is on it’s own window.
