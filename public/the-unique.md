While not incredibly unique, this one certainly does have its quirks. The ’n’ is the first letter that stands out as being a bit odd. The shape of the letter doesn’t seem to quite match up with the flow of a pen. The connectors reach the next letter quite high – at the top of the x-height and the ‘e’ does it’s own thing at the end.
