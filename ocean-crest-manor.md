Ocean Crest Manor is a wonderful example of a casual script, which really suits the beach-y feel of the neighbourhood. The “r” has a particularly interesting shape with its wiggly termination and even though there isn’t a connector between every letter, the “e” and the “s” are joined very smoothly.

The letters seem to get more dense as they go. It seems to be a combination of the letters being closer together and the absence of the counters being cut out of the black backing. 

1817 Yew Street
