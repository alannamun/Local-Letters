This is one of my favourite examples of apartment lettering. The sharp edges and angled curves of the script make it look like it was written quickly with a marker. The connection of the “o” is especially angular. The letters do vary in weight slightly with the “R” carrying the most weight. 

The choice to put “court” in a narrow uppercase sans-serif is a nice contrast to the script. The address number have been done in the same style, making this piece of lettering wonderfully cohesive.
